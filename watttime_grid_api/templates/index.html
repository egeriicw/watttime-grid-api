    <h1>Why WattTime Impact API?</h1>
    <p>
        The CO2 intensity of electricity varies in real time throughout the day. Ever wanted to know...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What time of day has the cleanest energy in New England?</li>
        <li>What is the carbon footprint of my electricity,
            <a href="{% url 'map' %}">right here, right now</a>?</li>
        <li>How variable is wind power production in the Midwest?</li></li>
        <li>Is California on track to meet its <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/portfolio/">33%-by-2020 renewable portfolio standard</a>?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It turns out that for most parts of the US, the data to answer 
        these kind of questions are freely and openly available. But these 
        data are scattered in wildly different formats across a wide 
        variety of sources, not all of which are exactly easy to find.
    </p>
    <p>
        The WattTime Impact API standardizes this information to empower app developers
        to build cool tools that make real-time electricity data accessible, 
        exciting, and actionable. It's also useful for data analysts who want a single portal
        that provides energy cleanliness data in a simple, queryable, standardized format.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="row" id="data">
    <h1>What data are available?</h1>
    <p>
        Geographically, the data are organized the same way the grid is:
        into "balancing authorities" that manage supply and demand for a given service area.
        The bigger balancing authorities, called
        Independent Services Operators and Regional Transmission Organizations
        (<a href="//www.isorto.org/">ISOs/RTOs</a>),
        together cover about 2/3 of US electricity consumers.        
    </p>
    <p>
        The API provides data for nearly every ISO/RTO region in the country (and metadata for many others):
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>CAISO</dt><dd>California</dd>
        <dt>BPA</dt><dd>Pacific Northwest</dd>
        <dt>MISO</dt><dd>Upper Midwest</dd>
        <dt>SPP</dt><dd>Central Midwest</dd>
        <dt>ERCOT</dt><dd>Texas</dd>
        <dt>ISONE</dt><dd>New England</dd>
        <dt>PJM</dt><dd>Mid-Atlantic</dd>
    </dl>    
    <p>
        The only ISO/RTO region we are unable to support is NYISO (the New York ISO), which does not make its real-time
        fuel mix information public.
    </p>
    <div class="well well-sm">
        Tip: You can find out what ISO/RTO a user is in by providing geospatial parameters to the
        <a href="{% url 'django.swagger.base.view' %}#!/balancing_authorities">balancing_authorities</a>
        endpoint.
    </div>

    <p>
        As befits a real-time data service, there are also time-series oriented dataâ€”what's
        happening on the regional grid at a particular moment?
        In addition to metadata about data provenance,
        two kinds of data types are provided for each time series data point:
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>Generation mix</dt>
        <dd>
            The power on the grid is generated from different fuel sources at different times;
            sometimes there's more coal, other times there's more wind.
            (We count wind and other renewables as types of fuels for ease of comparison.)
            The API provides the number of megawatts generated from each fuel.
            Pie charts or <a href="//bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060954">streamgraphs</a>, anyone?
        </dd>
        <dt>Carbon footprint</dt>
        <dd>
            Because the generation mix is constantly changing,
            the carbon impact of electricity use is constantly changing too.
            The API provides carbon emissions intensity in pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> per megawatt-hour
            for each fuel typ. Combine with a user's <a href="//www.greenbuttondata.org/">Green Button data</a>
            for a high-resolution localized carbon footprint analysis!
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <div class="well well-sm">
        Tip: You can select specific date ranges by providing start and end time parameters to the
        <a href="{% url 'django.swagger.base.view' %}#!/datapoints">datapoints</a>
        endpoint.
    </div>

<div class="row" id="sources">
    <h1>Where do the data come from?</h1>
    <p>  
        Power generation data is pulled straight from the ISOs in real time,
        as frequently as they release it:
        every 5 minutes in ISONE, MISO, PJM, and BPA;
        every 10 minutes in CAISO;
        and every hour in ERCOT.
        Plus, every morning,
        SPP releases yesterday's 5-minutely data,
        and CAISO releases yesterday's detailed hourly data.
        We combine all this with 
        <a href="//www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=74&t=11">CO2 emissions factors</a>
        from the Energy Information Administration
        to calculate the carbon impact of energy use in each place at each time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a few cases we have to use approximations if a region combines two fuel types.
        For example, BPA's data focuses primarily on its substantial renewable energy resources 
        and doesn't distinguish between different types of thermal power plants. These 
        approximations are all clearly marked in our data stream. Stay tuned
        for further improvements in our ability to disaggregate different fuel types.

    <h1>How can I use the API?</h1>
    <p>
        Get started by checking out the
        <a href="{% url 'django.swagger.base.view' %}">interactive documentation</a>
        and the
        <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/watttime-api-users">user group</a>.
        It's a standard RESTful JSON API, so you can make HTTP requests to API endpoints
        using any of your favorite tools, from iOS to d3.js to curl.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right now, the API is completely free and open:
        no authorization, no rate limits, no fees.
        Please be respectful of our limited server resources.
        Data availability terms are subject to change without notice,
        although of course we'll do our best to keep the
        <a href="//groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/watttime-api-users">user group</a>
        informed about any upcoming changes.
    </p>
